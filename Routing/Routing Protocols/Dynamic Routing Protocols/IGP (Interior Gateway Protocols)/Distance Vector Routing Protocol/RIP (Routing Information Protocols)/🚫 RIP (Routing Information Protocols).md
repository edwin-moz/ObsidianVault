_An older routing protocol with basic routing and no subnetting._

Why did we go away from RIPv1?

It is not scalable, with slow convergence, and classful addressing only. It has a maximum hop count of 15 and updates every 30 seconds which causes huge network overloads. RIPv1 routers had no authentication.

RIPv2 was adopted to fix some of the problems with RIPv1.

It is a classless protocol and supports authentication. It swapped broadcast for multicast and updates every 90 seconds.
